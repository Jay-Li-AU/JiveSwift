A Jive ios example using Swift Language
-------------------------------
The example is based on xcode 6 beta 4. Since xcode is unstable, it may not be able to compile in other versions of xcode. 


1.Run 'pod install'

 For usage of CocoaPod, please check out http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/streamlining-cocoa-development-with-cocoapods--mobile-15938

2.Fix compilation issue

 Change 'and' in the last method of JivePeopleRequestOptions.h and JivePeopleRequestOptions.m  to other non-keyword word such as 'andx'
